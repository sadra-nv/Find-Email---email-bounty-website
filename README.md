# FindEmail.io Redesign

## Live Demo

- **Main Site**: [https://find-email33.vercel.app/](https://find-email33.vercel.app/)
- **User Dashboard**: [https://find-email33.vercel.app/dashboard/profile](https://find-email33.vercel.app/dashboard/profile)

## Technologies Used
- Next.js 14 - app router , Tailwind CSS, TypeScript

## Overview
This project is a redesign of the [FindEmail.io](https://findemail.io) website, developed as a freelance job. The project focuses on creating a modern, highly animated, user-friendly interface. However, the project was cancelled approximately halfway through, specifically during the integration with the backend. As a result, some components remain duplicated, and planned refactoring to create dynamic components based on backend data was not completed.

## Notes
- The project was abandoned before full backend connectivity was established, the offline branch is static and the main branch is the latest version.
- Duplicated components exist in the codebase, which were intended to be refactored into a single dynamic component.

## Project Status
- **Front-End**: Most styles and UI components are complete, built for a clean and responsive user experience.
- **Backend Integration**: Initiated but incomplete due to project cancellation.
- **Code Quality**: Contains some duplicated components and messier code, as refactoring was not performed.
- **Future Plans**: Originally intended to consolidate duplicated components into a single dynamic component driven by backend data, but this was not implemented.

## Contributing
As this was a cancelled freelance project, contributions are not actively sought. However, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with improvements
